# Wireless Encryption 

We are using a QR Code functionality to make Keytable for each button in any wireless device and trying to take input accordingly.

After the machines have their own Communication language which they can modify anytime it becomes impossible to crack the wireless transmission

I want to make a language track such that the each button will have certain code corresponding to it 

when we keep on sending the button clicked in form of code we can also edit the code any time which makes it randomization in structure.

---------------------------------------------------------

## First Use keyboard.cpp 
to create a keytable

## Second use qc.py 
to create QR Code for the keytable

## Right Now we have not made QR Scanner (We will need Phone camera to scan QR Code) We will have to create software for connecting keyboard,mobile and Laptop

## For now we are using keyboard.txt file to decrypt 

## So run receiver.py lastly as you can see each time we press any button it converts to a keytable code and sends to the laptop and laptop decrypts it using its mutual keyvalue
